An interrupt is a signal, indicating an event that must be
executed immediately, from a program which causes the operating system to stop any running
processes in order to handle the event sent by the signal. After the interrupt event has been handled the
program will continue running where it left off .
A callback is a function which can be passed as an argument to another function. This can be used to
enforce an order of operations in a program. Threading allows the program to execute other code while
waiting for another event to complete. A threaded callback occurs when a callback function is run in a
second thread while the main function continues to run.
