An SPI is a serial synchronous type of communication which allows 2 devices to synchronise the
exchange of data through a common clock signal. In the timing diagram below it can be seen that the
clock is an oscillating signal. The clock tells the receiver when to sample the received signal. The
received signal is either sampled on the rising edge or falling edge of the clock. In this case, it can be
seen that, the signal is sampled on the rising edge of the clock. When this edge is detected by the
receiver the data line is read to determine the next bit.
